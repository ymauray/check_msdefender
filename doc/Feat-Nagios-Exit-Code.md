> Fix exit value of process so it matches what is expected by nagios:
  Current Status:  OK  
  Status Information:    UNKNOWN: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/nagios/etc/check_msdefender.ini'



⏺ Now I can see the issue! The problem is that the CLI commands return the exit codes but Click doesn't actually exit with those codes. Let me look at how the commands are
  structured and the main entry point.

⏺ The issues I found are:

  1. Commands return exit codes but don't actually exit: In lastseen.py:48, the command returns an exit code but Click doesn't use it to exit the process
  2. Missing sys.exit() calls: The code prints error messages but doesn't exit with the proper code
  3. Inconsistent exit codes: Some places use return 3, others just print and continue

  For Nagios, the standard exit codes are:
  - 0: OK
  - 1: WARNING
  - 2: CRITICAL
  - 3: UNKNOWN
